UI Component Patterns (from StoreSave, StoreLoad, StoreSync)\n\n**File Structure:**\n- Store workflows are in `/web/src/pages/Store{Workflow}.jsx` (e.g., `StoreSave.jsx`, `StoreLoad.jsx`)\n- Each follows a consistent layout pattern:\n  ```jsx\n  <div className=\"page\">\n    <div className=\"page-header\">\n      <div>\n        <h1 className=\"page-title\">Store Extract</h1>\n        <p className=\"page-subtitle\">Pull specific artifacts from the store</p>\n      </div>\n      <NavLink to=\"/store\" className=\"btn\">Back to Store</NavLink>\n    </div>\n    \n    {/* Error display */}\n    {error && <div className=\"card\" style={{ borderColor: 'var(--accent-red)' }}>...</div>}\n    \n    {/* Main content grid */}\n    <div style={{ display: 'grid', gridTemplateColumns: '1fr 320px', gap: '1.5rem' }}>\n      {/* Main Form */}\n      <div>\n        <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>\n          {/* Input fields */}\n          <div className=\"card\">\n            <div className=\"card-title\">Extract Options</div>\n            {/* ... form fields ... */}\n          </div>\n          \n          {/* Submit button */}\n          <button type=\"submit\" className=\"btn btn-primary\">...</button>\n        </form>\n      </div>\n      \n      {/* Help Panel */}\n      <div>\n        <div className=\"card help-panel\">...</div>\n        {/* Quick links */}\n        <div className=\"card help-panel\">...</div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  ```\n\n**Key UI Patterns:**\n- **Input Fields**: Use `<input className=\"form-input\">` with proper labels and help text\n- **Error Display**: Cards with colored borders (red for errors, amber for warnings, green for success)\n- **Form Validation**: Check required fields before submission\n- **Loading States**: Disable form during submission with loading text\n- **Help Panels**: Consistent card styling with documentation\n\n### 2. API/Job Execution Patterns (from App.jsx and backend)\n\n**Job Context Pattern:**\n```jsx\n// In App.jsx - JobsProvider\nconst createJob = async (command, args = [], envOverrides = {}) => {\n  const res = await fetch('/api/jobs', {\n    method: 'POST',\n    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },\n    body: JSON.stringify({ command, args, envOverrides })\n  })\n  if (res.ok) {\n    await fetchJobs()\n    return await res.json()\n  }\n  throw new Error('Failed to create job')\n}\n```\n\n**Request Pattern (from Store workflows):**\n```jsx\nconst handleSubmit = async (e) => {\n  e.preventDefault()\n  setError(null)\n  setSubmitting(true)\n\n  try {\n    const requestPayload = {\n      artifactRef: artifactRef || undefined,\n      outputDir: outputDir || undefined\n    }\n\n    // Filter out undefined values\n    Object.keys(requestPayload).forEach(key => {\n      if (requestPayload[key] === undefined) {\n        delete requestPayload[key]\n      }\n    })\n\n    const res = await fetch('/api/store/extract', {\n      method: 'POST',\n      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },\n      body: JSON.stringify(requestPayload)\n    })\n\n    const data = await res.json()\n\n    if (!res.ok) {\n      throw new Error(data.message || 'Extract request failed')\n    }\n\n    // Navigate to job detail\n    await fetchJobs()\n    navigate(`/jobs/${data.jobId}`)\n  } catch (err) {\n    setError(err.message)\n  } finally {\n    setSubmitting(false)\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Command Building Logic (from backend handler.go)\n\n**Pattern for store operations:**\n```go\n// In backend/internal/store/handler.go\n// Extract handles POST /api/store/extract\nfunc (h *Handler) Extract(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n  // Decode request\n  var req ExtractRequest\n  if err := json.NewDecoder(r.Body).Decode(&req); err != nil {\n    http.Error(w, \"Invalid request body: \"+err.Error(), http.StatusBadRequest)\n    return\n  }\n\n  // Build args for hauler store extract command\n  args := []string{\"store\", \"extract\"}\n\n  // Add artifact reference (required)\n  if req.ArtifactRef != \"\" {\n    args = append(args, req.ArtifactRef)\n  }\n\n  // Add output directory\n  if req.OutputDir != \"\" {\n    args = append(args, \"--output\", req.OutputDir)\n  }\n\n  // Create and start job\n  job, err := h.jobRunner.CreateJob(r.Context(), \"hauler\", args, nil)\n  if err != nil {\n    log.Printf(\"Error creating extract job: %v\", err)\n    http.Error(w, \"Failed to create extract job\", http.StatusInternalServerError)\n    return\n  }\n\n  // Start job in background\n  go func() {\n    if err := h.jobRunner.Start(r.Context(), job.ID); err != nil {\n      log.Printf(\"Error starting extract job %d: %v\", job.ID, err)\n    }\n  }()\n\n  // Return job ID\n  w.Header().Set(\"Content-Type\", \"application/json\")\n  w.WriteHeader(http.StatusAccepted)\n  _ = json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(map[string]interface{}{\n    \"jobId\": job.ID,\n    \"message\": \"Extract job started\",\n    \"artifactRef\": req.ArtifactRef,\n    \"outputDir\": req.OutputDir,\n  })\n}\n```\n\n**Request/Response Structures:**\n```go\n// ExtractRequest represents the request to extract from store\ntype ExtractRequest struct {\n  ArtifactRef string `json:\"artifactRef\"`  // e.g., \"docker.io/library/nginx:latest\"\n  OutputDir   string `json:\"outputDir\"`    // e.g., \"/path/to/output\"\n}\n```\n\n### 4. File/Directory Selector Patterns\n\n**Current Patterns:**\n- **Simple text input**: Used in all store workflows for file paths\n- **No file dialogs**: The current UI uses text inputs with placeholders\n- **Path validation**: Not implemented in frontend - relies on backend validation\n\n**Example pattern from StoreAddFile:**\n```jsx\n<div className=\"form-group\">\n  <label className=\"form-label\">File Path</label>\n  <input\n    className=\"form-input\"\n    placeholder=\"/path/to/local/file.txt\"\n    value={filePath}\n    onChange={(e) => setFilePath(e.target.value)}\n    disabled={loading}\n  />\n  <div style={{ fontSize: '0.75rem', color: 'var(--text-muted)', marginTop: '0.35rem' }}>\n    Path to a local file on the filesystem\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\nFor directory selection, you could follow the same pattern:\n```jsx\n<div className=\"form-group\">\n  <label className=\"form-label\">Output Directory</label>\n  <input\n    className=\"form-input\"\n    placeholder=\"/path/to/output/directory\"\n    value={outputDir}\n    onChange={(e) => setOutputDir(e.target.value)}\n    disabled={loading}\n  />\n  <div style={{ fontSize: '0.75rem', color: 'var(--text-muted)', marginTop: '0.35rem' }}>\n    Directory where extracted files will be saved\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n### 5. Job Display and Log Streaming (from App.jsx JobDetail)\n\n**Automatic log streaming:**\n```jsx\n// In JobDetail component\nuseEffect(() => {\n  // Set up SSE for streaming if job is running\n  const eventSource = new EventSource(`/api/jobs/${jobId}/stream`)\n\n  eventSource.addEventListener('log', (e) => {\n    const data = JSON.parse(e.data)\n    setLogs(prev => [...prev, data])\n  })\n\n  eventSource.addEventListener('complete', (e) => {\n    const data = JSON.parse(e.data)\n    setJob(data)\n    eventSource.close()\n  })\n\n  return () => eventSource.close()\n}, [jobId])\n```\n\n**Result display pattern (for showing extracted files):**\n```jsx\n{job.status === 'succeeded' && job.result && (() => {\n  try {\n    const result = JSON.parse(job.result)\n    if (result.extractedFiles && result.outputDir) {\n      return (\n        <div className=\"card\" style={{ borderColor: 'var(--accent-green)' }}>\n          <div className=\"card-title\" style={{ color: 'var(--accent-green)' }}>\n            ✓ Extraction Complete\n          </div>\n          <div style={{ color: 'var(--text-secondary)', fontSize: '0.9rem', lineHeight: '1.6' }}>\n            <p style={{ marginBottom: '0.5rem' }}>\n              <strong>Output directory:</strong> <code>{result.outputDir}</code>\n            </p>\n            <p style={{ marginBottom: '0.5rem' }}>\n              <strong>Files extracted:</strong> {result.extractedFiles.length}\n            </p>\n            {result.extractedFiles.map((file, i) => (\n              <div key={i} style={{ fontFamily: 'var(--font-mono)', fontSize: '0.85rem' }}>\n                • {file}\n              </div>\n            ))}\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      )\n    }\n  } catch {\n    return null\n  }\n})()}\n```\n\n### 6. Navigation and Routing (from App.jsx)\n\n**Route pattern:**\n```jsx\n// Add to App.jsx Routes\n<Route path=\"/store/extract\" element={<StoreExtract />} />\n\n// Add to Store page operations\n{ id: 'extract', name: 'Extract', description: 'Extract artifacts from the store', icon: '📤', route: '/store/extract' }\n```\n\n### 7. Backend Implementation Requirements\n\n1. **Add handler function** in `backend/internal/store/handler.go`\n2. **Register route** in `RegisterRoutes()` function\n3. **Define request/response structs** for the extract operation\n4. **Handle command building** for `hauler store extract <artifact> --output <dir>`\n5. **Return job ID** for frontend to track progress\n\n### Key Implementation Points for US-016:\n\n1. **Two main inputs**: \n   - Artifact reference (string) - the hauler artifact to extract\n   - Output directory (string) - where to save extracted files\n\n2. **Command format**: `hauler store extract <artifact-ref> --output <directory>`\n\n3. **UI follows existing patterns**: \n   - Text inputs for both fields\n   - Validation for required fields\n   - Job creation and navigation\n   - Log streaming in job detail\n\n4. **Result display**: Show output directory and list of extracted files after completion\n\nThe implementation should closely follow the established patterns in StoreSave, StoreLoad, and StoreSync for consistency with the existing codebase."},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: a881e87 (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)"}]}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"b28ffdf8-5d02-4b97-b1c2-cd2b144fa745","uuid":"2337d6cc-3c59-4f25-bbbc-ad769f9df456","tool_use_result":{"status":"completed","prompt":"Explore the codebase to understand how the existing store workflows (Store Save, Store Load, Store Sync) are implemented.

Navigation and Routing (from App.jsx)\n\n**Route pattern:**\n```jsx\n// Add to App.jsx Routes\n<Route path=\"/store/extract\" element={<StoreExtract />} />\n\n// Add to Store page operations\n{ id: 'extract', name: 'Extract', description: 'Extract artifacts from the store', icon: '📤', route: '/store/extract' }\n```\n\n### 7. Backend Implementation Requirements\n\n1. **Add handler function** in `backend/internal/store/handler.go`\n2. **Register route** in `RegisterRoutes()` function\n3. **Define request/response structs** for the extract operation\n4. **Handle command building** for `hauler store extract <artifact> --output <dir>`\n5. **Return job ID** for frontend to track progress\n\n### Key Implementation Points for US-016:\n\n1. **Two main inputs**: \n   - Artifact reference (string) - the hauler artifact to extract\n   - Output directory (string) - where to save extracted files\n\n2. **Command format**: `hauler store extract <artifact-ref> --output <directory>`\n\n3. **UI follows existing patterns**: \n   - Text inputs for both fields\n   - Validation for required fields\n   - Job creation and navigation\n   - Log streaming in job detail\n\n4. **Result display**: Show output directory and list of extracted files after completion\n\nThe implementation should closely follow the established patterns in StoreSave, StoreLoad, and StoreSync for consistency with the existing codebase."}],"totalDurationMs":161467,"totalTokens":0,"totalToolUseCount":19,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"output_tokens":0}}}

Navigate to page\nagent-browser open <url>\n\n# 2. Get interactive elements with refs (AI-friendly)\nagent-browser snapshot -i\n\n# 3. Interact using refs (@e1, @e2, etc.)\nagent-browser click @e2\nagent-browser fill @e3 \"text\"\n\n# 4. Re-snapshot after page changes\nagent-browser snapshot -i\n```\n\n**Why refs?** The snapshot output assigns stable references (`@e1`, `@e2`) to elements. These refs are deterministic and don't break if the page structure changes slightly.\n\n## Common Tasks\n\n### Form Filling\n\n```bash\nagent-browser open <url>\nagent-browser snapshot -i  # Get refs for form fields\nagent-browser fill @e3 \"email@example.com\"  # Email field\nagent-browser fill @e4 \"password123\"         # Password field\nagent-browser check @e5                      # Checkbox\nagent-browser select @e6 \"Option 2\"          # Dropdown\nagent-browser click @e7                      # Submit button\n```\n\n### Web Testing\n\n```bash\nagent-browser open https://example.com/login\nagent-browser snapshot -i\n\n# Fill login form\nagent-browser fill @e2 \"testuser@example.com\"\nagent-browser fill @e3 \"password123\"\nagent-browser click @e4  # Login button\n\n# Verify success -
