Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.\n\nThe user provides frontend requirements: a component, page, application, or interface to build. They may include context about the purpose, audience, or technical constraints.\n\n## Design Thinking\n\nBefore coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:\n- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?\n- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc. There are so many flavors to choose from. Use these for inspiration but design one that is true to the aesthetic direction.\n- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).\n- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?\n\n**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work - the key is intentionality, not intensity.\n\nThen implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:\n- Production-grade and functional\n- Visually striking and memorable\n- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view\n- Meticulously refined in every detail\n\n## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines\n\nFocus on:\n- **Typography**: Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter; opt instead for distinctive choices that elevate the frontend's aesthetics; unexpected, characterful font choices. Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font.\n- **Color & Theme**: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes.\n- **Motion**: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML. Use Motion library for React when available. Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions. Use scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise.\n- **Spatial Composition**: Unexpected layouts. Asymmetry. Overlap. Diagonal flow. Grid-breaking elements. Generous negative space OR controlled density.\n- **Backgrounds & Visual Details**: Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Add contextual effects and textures that match the overall aesthetic. Apply creative forms like gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders, custom cursors, and grain overlays.\n\nNEVER use generic AI-generated aesthetics like overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts), cliched color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds), predictable layouts and component patterns, and cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character.\n\nInterpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context. No design should be the same. Vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics. NEVER converge on common choices (Space Grotesk, for example) across generations.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision. Maximalist designs need elaborate code with extensive animations and effects. Minimalist or refined designs need restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing, typography, and subtle details. Elegance comes from executing the vision well.\n\nRemember: Claude is capable of extraordinary creative work. Don't hold back, show what can truly be created when thinking outside the box and committing fully to a distinctive vision."}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"722874c3-dd76-4159-9294-27ab0c99546e","uuid":"1f9db031-493e-46ec-886d-dd787b95b373","isSynthetic":true}

Frontend submits form to API endpoint\n2. Backend creates job in database with status \"queued\"\n3. Backend starts job in background goroutine\n4. Job updates status to \"running\" and executes hauler command\n5. Job logs are streamed to database in real-time\n6. Frontend polls for job status via SSE\n\n**Log Display (JobDetail component):**\n- Server-sent events (`/api/jobs/:id/stream`)\n- Three event types: `log`, `state`, `complete`\n- Real-time log streaming with timestamps\n- Job status updates (queued → running → succeeded/failed)\n\n### 5. **Warnings/Notifications**\n\n**Error Display:**\n- Red-bordered card with error message\n- Appears above form on submission failure\n\n**Warning Notifications:**\n- StoreSync has product registry warning banner\n- Styled with amber border and warning icon\n- Explains behavior changes and recommends actions\n\n**Success States:**\n- Green-bordered card with download link (Store Save)\n- Navigation to job detail page for all operations\n\n### 6. **Key Files to Reference for US-015 (Store Load)**\n\n**Frontend:**\n- `/web/src/pages/StoreSave.jsx` - Simple form pattern\n- `/web/src/pages/StoreSync.jsx` - Complex form with multiple options\n- `/web/src/App.jsx` - Routes, JobDetail component, useJobs hook\n\n**Backend:**\n- `/backend/internal/store/handler.go` - Handler implementation pattern\n- `/backend/internal/jobrunner/` - Job execution system\n- `/backend/internal/sqlite/migrations/0001_initial_schema.sql` - Database schema\n\n**Patterns to Follow:**\n1. Create a request struct matching hauler load options\n2. Implement `POST /api/store/load` endpoint\n3. Add route `/store/load` in App.jsx\n4. Create `StoreLoad.jsx` component following the same pattern\n5. Handle archive upload/file selection\n6. Implement proper error handling and success states\n7. Add help panel with documentation\n\nThe architecture is well-structured with clear separation of concerns.

Navigate to page\nagent-browser open <url>\n\n# 2. Get interactive elements with refs (AI-friendly)\nagent-browser snapshot -i\n\n# 3. Interact using refs (@e1, @e2, etc.)\nagent-browser click @e2\nagent-browser fill @e3 \"text\"\n\n# 4. Re-snapshot after page changes\nagent-browser snapshot -i\n```\n\n**Why refs?** The snapshot output assigns stable references (`@e1`, `@e2`) to elements. These refs are deterministic and don't break if the page structure changes slightly.\n\n## Common Tasks\n\n### Form Filling\n\n```bash\nagent-browser open <url>\nagent-browser snapshot -i  # Get refs for form fields\nagent-browser fill @e3 \"email@example.com\"  # Email field\nagent-browser fill @e4 \"password123\"         # Password field\nagent-browser check @e5                      # Checkbox\nagent-browser select @e6 \"Option 2\"          # Dropdown\nagent-browser click @e7                      # Submit button\n```\n\n### Web Testing\n\n```bash\nagent-browser open https://example.com/login\nagent-browser snapshot -i\n\n# Fill login form\nagent-browser fill @e2 \"testuser@example.com\"\nagent-browser fill @e3 \"password123\"\nagent-browser click @e4  # Login button\n\n# Verify success - wait for welcome message\nagent-browser wait --text \"Welcome\"\nagent-browser get title\n```\n\n### Data Extraction\n\n```bash\nagent-browser open <url>\nagent-browser snapshot -i\n\n# Get text content\nagent-browser get text @e1\nagent-browser get html @e2\nagent-browser get attr @e3 href\n\n# Count elements\nagent-browser get count \".item\"\n```\n\n### Screenshots & PDFs\n\n```bash\n# Screenshot visible area\nagent-browser screenshot output.png\n\n# Full page screenshot\nagent-browser screenshot --full page.png\n\n# Save as PDF\nagent-browser pdf report.pdf\n```\n\n### Waiting & Dynamic Content\n\n```bash\n# Wait for element to appear\nagent-browser wait \"#submit-button\"\n\n# Wait for text to appear\nagent-browser wait --text \"Success\"\n\n# Wait for URL pattern\nagent-browser wait --url \"**/dashboard\"\n\n# Wait for network idle\nagent-browser wait --load networkidle\n\n# Wait specific milliseconds\nagent-browser wait 5000\n```\n\n## Commands Reference\n\n### Navigation\n\n| Command | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| `open <url>` | Navigate to URL (alias: `goto`, `navigate`) |\n| `back` | Go back |\n| `forward` | Go forward |\n| `reload` | Reload page |\n| `close` | Close browser (alias: `quit`, `exit`) |\n\n### Actions\n\n| Command | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| `click <sel>` | Click element |\n| `dblclick <sel>` | Double-click element |\n| `fill <sel> <text>` | Clear and fill input |\n| `type <sel> <text>` | Type without clearing |\n| `check <sel>` | Check checkbox |\n| `uncheck <sel>` | Uncheck checkbox |\n| `select <sel> <val>` | Select dropdown option |\n| `hover <sel>` | Hover over element |\n| `scroll <dir> [px]` | Scroll (up/down/left/right) |\n| `press <key>` | Press key (Enter, Tab, Control+a) |\n| `upload <sel> <files>` | Upload files |\n\n### Get Information\n\n| Command | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| `get text <sel>` | Get text content |\n| `get html <sel>` | Get innerHTML |\n| `get value <sel>` | Get input value |\n| `get attr <sel> <attr>` | Get attribute |\n| `get title` | Get page title |\n| `get url` | Get current URL |\n| `get box <sel>` | Get bounding box position |\n| `get count <sel>` | Count matching elements |\n\n### Check State\n\n| Command | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| `is visible <sel>` | Check if element is visible |\n| `is enabled <sel>` | Check if element is enabled |\n| `is checked <sel>` | Check if checkbox is checked |\n\n### Snapshot Options\n\n| Option | Description |\n|--------|-------------|\n| `-i, --interactive` | Only interactive elements |\n| `-c, --compact` | Remove empty structural elements |\n| `-d 3` | Limit depth to 3 levels |\n| `-s \"#main\"` | Scope to CSS selector |\n\n### Browser Settings\n\n| Command | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| `set viewport <w> <h>` | Set viewport size |\n| `set device \"iPhone 14\"` | Emulate device |\n| `set geo <lat> <lng>` | Set geolocation |\n| `set offline on/off` | Toggle offline mode |\n| `set headers <json>` | Set HTTP headers |\n\n### Cookies & Storage\n\n| Command | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| `cookies` | Get all cookies |\n| `cookies set <name> <val>` | Set cookie |\n| `cookies clear` | Clear cookies |\n| `storage local` | Get localStorage |\n| `storage local set <k> <v>` | Set localStorage value |\n| `storage local clear` | Clear localStorage |\n\n## Selectors\n\n### Refs (Recommended)\n\nRefs from snapshot output: `@e1`, `@e2`, `@e3`...\n\n```bash\nagent-browser snapshot -i\n# Output: button \"Submit\" [ref=e2]\nagent-browser click @e2\n```\n\n### CSS Selectors\n\n```bash\nagent-browser click \"#id\"\nagent-browser click \".class\"\nagent-browser click \"button[type='submit']\"\n```\n\n### Text Selectors\n\n```bash\nagent-browser click \"text=Submit\"\nagent-browser click \"text=/Submit Form/\"\n```\n\n### Semantic Locators\n\n```bash\nagent-browser find role button click --name \"Submit\"\nagent-browser find label \"Email\" fill \"test@test.com\"\nagent-browser find text \"Sign In\" click\n```\n\n## Authenticated Sessions\n\nSkip login flows using HTTP headers:\n\n```bash\nagent-browser open api.example.com --headers '{\"Authorization\": \"Bearer <token>\"}'\n```\n\nHeaders are scoped to the origin -

The overall architecture - where are the store workflow components located?\n2. How the UI components are structured (input fields, forms, job execution)\n3. How the API calls are made to the hauler backend\n4. The pattern used for job execution and log display\n5. How warnings/notifications are displayed\n\nFocus on files related to:\n- Store Save workflow (US-014)\n- Store Sync workflow (US-013)\n- Any shared store workflow components\n\nProvide file paths and key implementation details I should follow when implementing US-015 (Store Load workflow).",
