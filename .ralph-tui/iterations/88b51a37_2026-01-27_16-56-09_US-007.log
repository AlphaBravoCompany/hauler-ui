Once you understand what you're building, present the design in small sections (200-300 words), checking after each section whether it looks right so far.\n\n## The Process\n\n**Understanding the idea:**\n- Check out the current project state first (files, docs, recent commits)\n- Ask questions one at a time to refine the idea\n- Prefer multiple choice questions when possible, but open-ended is fine too\n- Only one question per message - if a topic needs more exploration, break it into multiple questions\n- Focus on understanding: purpose, constraints, success criteria\n\n**Exploring approaches:**\n- Propose 2-3 different approaches with trade-offs\n- Present options conversationally with your recommendation and reasoning\n- Lead with your recommended option and explain why\n\n**Presenting the design:**\n- Once you believe you understand what you're building, present the design\n- Break it into sections of 200-300 words\n- Ask after each section whether it looks right so far\n- Cover: architecture, components, data flow, error handling, testing\n- Be ready to go back and clarify if something doesn't make sense\n\n## After the Design\n\n**Documentation:**\n- Write the validated design to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`\n- Use elements-of-style:writing-clearly-and-concisely skill if available\n- Commit the design document to git\n\n**Implementation (if continuing):**\n- Ask: \"Ready to set up for implementation?\"\n- Use superpowers:using-git-worktrees to create isolated workspace\n- Use superpowers:writing-plans to create detailed implementation plan\n\n## Key Principles\n\n- **One question at a time** - Don't overwhelm with multiple questions\n- **Multiple choice preferred** - Easier to answer than open-ended when possible\n- **YAGNI ruthlessly** - Remove unnecessary features from all designs\n- **Explore alternatives** - Always propose 2-3 approaches before settling\n- **Incremental validation** - Present design in sections, validate each\n- **Be flexible** - Go back and clarify when something doesn't make sense\n"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"a57cd366-64aa-41f2-b3b1-3f132f6620c5","uuid":"a1d2487a-1e36-46d6-8f59-fcdef55a2a7c","isSynthetic":true}

Navigate to page\nagent-browser open <url>\n\n# 2. Get interactive elements with refs (AI-friendly)\nagent-browser snapshot -i\n\n# 3. Interact using refs (@e1, @e2, etc.)\nagent-browser click @e2\nagent-browser fill @e3 \"text\"\n\n# 4. Re-snapshot after page changes\nagent-browser snapshot -i\n```\n\n**Why refs?** The snapshot output assigns stable references (`@e1`, `@e2`) to elements. These refs are deterministic and don't break if the page structure changes slightly.\n\n## Common Tasks\n\n### Form Filling\n\n```bash\nagent-browser open <url>\nagent-browser snapshot -i  # Get refs for form fields\nagent-browser fill @e3 \"email@example.com\"  # Email field\nagent-browser fill @e4 \"password123\"         # Password field\nagent-browser check @e5                      # Checkbox\nagent-browser select @e6 \"Option 2\"          # Dropdown\nagent-browser click @e7                      # Submit button\n```\n\n### Web Testing\n\n```bash\nagent-browser open https://example.com/login\nagent-browser snapshot -i\n\n# Fill login form\nagent-browser fill @e2 \"testuser@example.com\"\nagent-browser fill @e3 \"password123\"\nagent-browser click @e4  # Login button\n\n# Verify success - wait for welcome message\nagent-browser wait --text \"Welcome\"\nagent-browser get title\n```\n\n### Data Extraction\n\n```bash\nagent-browser open <url>\nagent-browser snapshot -i\n\n# Get text content\nagent-browser get text @e1\nagent-browser get html @e2\nagent-browser get attr @e3 href\n\n# Count elements\nagent-browser get count \".item\"\n```\n\n### Screenshots & PDFs\n\n```bash\n# Screenshot visible area\nagent-browser screenshot output.png\n\n# Full page screenshot\nagent-browser screenshot --full page.png\n\n# Save as PDF\nagent-browser pdf report.pdf\n```\n\n### Waiting & Dynamic Content\n\n```bash\n# Wait for element to appear\nagent-browser wait \"#submit-button\"\n\n# Wait for text to appear\nagent-browser wait --text \"Success\"\n\n# Wait for URL pattern\nagent-browser wait --url \"**/dashboard\"\n\n# Wait for network idle\nagent-browser wait --load networkidle\n\n# Wait specific milliseconds\nagent-browser wait 5000\n```\n\n## Commands Reference\n\n### Navigation\n\n| Command | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| `open <url>` | Navigate to URL (alias: `goto`, `navigate`) |\n| `back` | Go back |\n| `forward` | Go forward |\n| `reload` | Reload page |\n| `close` | Close browser (alias: `quit`, `exit`) |\n\n### Actions\n\n| Command | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| `click <sel>` | Click element |\n| `dblclick <sel>` | Double-click element |\n| `fill <sel> <text>` | Clear and fill input |\n| `type <sel> <text>` | Type without clearing |\n| `check <sel>` | Check checkbox |\n| `uncheck <sel>` | Uncheck checkbox |\n| `select <sel> <val>` | Select dropdown option |\n| `hover <sel>` | Hover over element |\n| `scroll <dir> [px]` | Scroll (up/down/left/right) |\n| `press <key>` | Press key (Enter, Tab, Control+a) |\n| `upload <sel> <files>` | Upload files |\n\n### Get Information\n\n| Command | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| `get text <sel>` | Get text content |\n| `get html <sel>` | Get innerHTML |\n| `get value <sel>` | Get input value |\n| `get attr <sel> <attr>` | Get attribute |\n| `get title` | Get page title |\n| `get url` | Get current URL |\n| `get box <sel>` | Get bounding box position |\n| `get count <sel>` | Count matching elements |\n\n### Check State\n\n| Command | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| `is visible <sel>` | Check if element is visible |\n| `is enabled <sel>` | Check if element is enabled |\n| `is checked <sel>` | Check if checkbox is checked |\n\n### Snapshot Options\n\n| Option | Description |\n|--------|-------------|\n| `-i, --interactive` | Only interactive elements |\n| `-c, --compact` | Remove empty structural elements |\n| `-d 3` | Limit depth to 3 levels |\n| `-s \"#main\"` | Scope to CSS selector |\n\n### Browser Settings\n\n| Command | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| `set viewport <w> <h>` | Set viewport size |\n| `set device \"iPhone 14\"` | Emulate device |\n| `set geo <lat> <lng>` | Set geolocation |\n| `set offline on/off` | Toggle offline mode |\n| `set headers <json>` | Set HTTP headers |\n\n### Cookies & Storage\n\n| Command | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| `cookies` | Get all cookies |\n| `cookies set <name> <val>` | Set cookie |\n| `cookies clear` | Clear cookies |\n| `storage local` | Get localStorage |\n| `storage local set <k> <v>` | Set localStorage value |\n| `storage local clear` | Clear localStorage |\n\n## Selectors\n\n### Refs (Recommended)\n\nRefs from snapshot output: `@e1`, `@e2`, `@e3`...\n\n```bash\nagent-browser snapshot -i\n# Output: button \"Submit\" [ref=e2]\nagent-browser click @e2\n```\n\n### CSS Selectors\n\n```bash\nagent-browser click \"#id\"\nagent-browser click \".class\"\nagent-browser click \"button[type='submit']\"\n```\n\n### Text Selectors\n\n```bash\nagent-browser click \"text=Submit\"\nagent-browser click \"text=/Submit Form/\"\n```\n\n### Semantic Locators\n\n```bash\nagent-browser find role button click --name \"Submit\"\nagent-browser find label \"Email\" fill \"test@test.com\"\nagent-browser find text \"Sign In\" click\n```\n\n## Authenticated Sessions\n\nSkip login flows using HTTP headers:\n\n```bash\nagent-browser open api.example.com --headers '{\"Authorization\": \"Bearer <token>\"}'\n```\n\nHeaders are scoped to the origin -
